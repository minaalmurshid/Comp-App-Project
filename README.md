# Comp-App-Project
BME3053C Final Project

There are two program files, each that corresponds to a stage of our project. CompAppProject1.mlx was the code that was used for the first portion of the project, the thresholding tests, and CompAppProject2.mlx corresponds to the stage prediction phase of our project.

A sample of the dataset was uploaded and condensed, and the Patient Data spreadsheet contains demographic info of the patients and their corresponding ID from the dataset, since the dataset had this information organized much differently. It was condensed for the ease of running the code and working within one MATLAB directory.

Patient CT images can be found in the "Patient CTs" branch of the repository.

The Thresholding Tests and Stage Prediction Results spreadsheets contain the data returned from the code, condensed in an organized manner.
